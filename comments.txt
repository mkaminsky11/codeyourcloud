Installed your app in google business apps, associates fine with filetyles (xml, php etc)... however every time I try to open a file to edit, I get sent to this stupid about page. I log in with google to your about page, go back to google drive, looks like its loading the document and then redirects back to about.

Unfortunate, I was really excited to try this.
