####Now supports [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)!

###Goal
To allow people around the globe to collaborate on coding projects via Google Drive and OneDrive. It's that simple. So far, I have yet to see a website or program that accomplishes these tasks for all major programming languages. This is an attempt to change that, and it seems to be working well so far.
